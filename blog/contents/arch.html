            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>This wasn't my first time installing Arch Linux, I had
                done it before on an old laptop, but this time I 
                installed it manually on a QEMU/KVM Virtual Machine.
                Why? I saw a video of some guy attempting to install Arch
                Linux on a virtual machine and thought I should do that. 
                Maybe I could learn something for Linux.
            </p>
            <h3>How long it took and how difficult.</h3>
            <p>I didn't set a timer but most likely it 
                took 50 minutes, using the official Arch Wiki
                and Gemini for partition errors.
                The difficulty was probably 'intermiedate', most of it
                wasn't hard to do, the only difficult part was 
                trying to fix accidentally 'formatting a bios partition'.
            </p>

            <p>In conclusion, here's a cool arch pfp.</p>
